# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
GuardDuty found that the I launched a brute force attack from the attacker instance to the 
web service instance by trying to guess the password of the web service instance's root account

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
According to AWS GuardDuty documentation, GuardDuty analyzes tens of billions of events across multiple AWS data sources, 
such as AWS CloudTrail event logs, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs.

For this specific attack, I believe it used the CloudTrail log to identify the attack.
